# ScanMan

ScanMan 1.1 last updated on December 10, 2020 by Judge Manzano

The application was developed by Judge Manzano as part of his "Extending a Scanning Tool" output. It was developed using Python and the python3-nmap library to extend nmap scanning capabilities. It allows the user to perform basic ICMP and TCP scanning on the user inputted IP addresses and port. After performing the scans, it then displays the information in an easy to read table format. Additionally, it also records the time that it took to complete a scan.

python3-nmap library: https://pypi.org/project/python3-nmap/
